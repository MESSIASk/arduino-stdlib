This is an autotools package for building and installing the arduino
libraries.  It will install the libraries in a directory name based
on the MMCU and MHz specified in the configure script.

You may also specify the variant of the arduino.  Possible variants are:
 standard
 eightanaloginputs  
 leonardo  
 mega  
 micro

NOTE: As of Feb 16, 2012, the SoftwareSerial library has a bug in it and
      will not compile for the leonardo variant.  You'll have to comment
      it out in Makefile.am.

To compile the libraries, you must have the following packages installed:

   gcc-avr
   avr-libc

In a nutshell, to install the libraries, run the following commands:

   ./configure --prefix=<installdir> VARIANT=<variant-type> MMCU=<mmcu-type> MHZ=<mmcu-speed-in-MHz>
   make
   sudo make install

By default MMCU/MHZ defaults to atmega328p and 16 which is for an 
Arduino Uno.
