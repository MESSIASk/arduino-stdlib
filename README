This is an autotools package for building and installing the arduino
libraries.  It will install the libraries in a directory name based
on the MMCU and MHz specified in the configure script.

To compile the libraries, you must have the following packages installed:

   gcc-avr
   avr-libc

In a nutshell, to install the libraries, run the following commands:

   ./configure --prefix=<installdir> --host=avr \ 
      MMCU=<mmcu-type> MHZ=<mmcu-speed-in-MHz>
   make
   sudo make install

By default MMCU/MHZ defaults to atmega328p and 16 which is for an 
Arduino Uno.
